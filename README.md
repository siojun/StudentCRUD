A simple ASP.NET Core MVC application demonstrating CRUD operations for managing students and courses. Features include:

Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) for Students and Courses.

Many-to-many relationship between Students and Courses.

Search, pagination, and interactive UI with Bootstrap and Select2.

Responsive design and clean, beginner-friendly code for learning and portfolio purposes.

Note: This project uses my own local db, so it may require modifications to the connection string if running locally.
